Evil Hangman is a game in which the computer waits till the last possible minute to choose the word that the user is 
attempting to guess. If the user guesses a 'p', then it illiminates only words that contain a 'p'. Thus keeping its 
list of possible words as long as possible. The files here create this game, drawing from a global word set contained
in dictionary.txt
